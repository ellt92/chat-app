# A socket.io boilerplate

## Getting started
After installing all of the dependencies the ```webpack``` command should be run to build the clients javascript.
The html should be copied from ```static/src/``` to ```static/dist```.
The server can then be run using the ```npm run server``` command. 
The client should then be accesible at port ```3000```. Should the socket be successfully set up, the page will receive a message from the server.
